For use on HTML5 version of [http://haxball.com](http://haxball.com). This extension asks for permission to store information on your computer to keep track of your selection for which tool to enable, and also your most recent room search term.

Haxball All-in-one Tool adds a few time-saving features to the existing HTML5 version of the game. It works with all rooms hosted on the HTML5 game!

**✓ Room Search (original idea by Raamyy)**: quickly filter rooms by their room names (or partial room names) using the search bar above the room list

| Search rooms by room name (exact or partial), with extra button to auto-join rooms |

**✓ Auto Join**: trying to join a full room? Select any room in the list and click Auto Join - it does the refreshing for you and clicks in the moment a slot is free

**✓ Admin Kick/Ban shortcuts**: having difficulties kicking or banning abusive users quickly? If you are an admin of the room, click ESC in the room player list view to add the [K]ick and [B]an buttons. One click operation to kick/ban any player :) (of course not the host)

| One-click buttons to [K]ick and [B]an - usable for room admins only! |

**✓ Local mute**: don't want to see a certain player's messages? Simply right click their name and press the mute button!
